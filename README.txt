Step for the classification of WBCs:
1) Upload this model folder on your Google Drive.
2) Open Google collab. (Make sure the google accounts are the same in both DRIVE and COLLAB).
3) Click on File->Upload Notebook, then upload the given Prediction_WBC.ipynb file.
4) Now run the cells one by one or go to Runtime and Click RunAll.
5) Maybe in the 2nd Cell (Drive mount cell), they may give a link, in that case just click on that link and select your proper google account(The Drive one)
   and you will get a key. Just copy it and paste it into the input box under the 2nd Cell.
(Most of the time drive gets automatically mounted so don't worry If link does not come up, just make sure there are no Errors)
6) Now your drive is mounted and you just have to run the cells.
  image_path is the variable for your path, Now refer to DRIVE.png, you can right-click on any image and copy its path and then you can paste it
	into the variable. (I will put the demo path)

After this, you will get the output.
